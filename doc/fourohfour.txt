*fourohfour.txt*	Lookup HTTP status codes without leaving Vim

Author: Josh Branchaud <http://joshbranchaud.com>

INTRODUCTION                    *fourohfour*

This plugin exposes the :FOF command which gives you a couple ways to
quickly lookup HTTP status codes.


:FOF {code}   If {code} is a known HTTP status code, a description of
              that code will be echoed. If {code} is Dxx, where D is some
              numeric value between 1 and 5, then a listing of status codes
              for that group will be echoed. If {code} is not recognized,
              then fourohfour will attempt to make some suggestions.
